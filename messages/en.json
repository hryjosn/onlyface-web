  "FAQItems": [
    {
      "question": "How does Onlyface work?",
      "answer": "Onlyface is a social networking app where users connect based on their physical appearance. Upon sign-up, users upload a selfie photo and enter a pending status. To become fully active, more than 1/3 of the total users must approve their photo."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the purpose of the pending status?",
      "answer": "The pending status allows existing users to vote on new members' photos, ensuring that the community maintains certain standards of attractiveness."
    },
    {
      "question": "What kind of photo should I upload for my profile?",
      "answer": "Choose a high-quality selfie that accurately represents your appearance. Ensure good lighting and avoid filters or heavily edited photos."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to get approval from the community?",
      "answer": "The approval process depends on the number of users and how quickly they vote. It may vary, but we aim for a timely and fair process."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I don't get enough votes for approval?",
      "answer": "If you don't receive enough votes, you will remain in pending status. You can continue to engage with the community and try again."
